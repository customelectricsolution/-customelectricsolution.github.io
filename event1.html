        <p>Have you ever wanted to build your own little toy- a toy that does something or other for you?<br>
        Perhaps the answer is no; in which case, would you like to understand the basics of how engineering gets done?<br>
        If the answer is still no, you can stop reading right here and search for something you find fun.
        </p>
        <p> 
            After having more than one person expressing a desire to better understand the fundamental tools of the engineering trade, I thought to offer such a learning opportunity. 
        Here is the outline created thus far: </p>
        <div style="color:yellow">
            -   Introduction to Engineering <br>
            -   Fundamental Principles in Engineering- aka Units of Measurements<br>
            -   Relationships between Units<br>
            -   Significance of Units in an Engineering Task<br>
        </div> <br />
        <p style="color: red;"><b>TL;DR: majority of discussion will be on scientific units and introductory level algebra. The reason: if your units do not match, your solution is definitely wrong.</b></p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Now, to address the question why bother listening to this stuff from me, here is a short
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:burlywood">About Me:</h2>
        <p>
        I have M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, and professional work experience of research and development, designing and prototyping electrical devices, failure analysis and troubleshooting, product quality, and production support.<br><br>
        
        In as far as experience in dissiminating technical information goes:
        Being a Calculus Tutor was my primary gig as an undergraduate. I was also a Group Mentor for a mechanical engineering class. I have been Teaching Assistant for courses including Introduction to Electronics lab, Introduction to Electromagnetics lab, and Senior Design project.
